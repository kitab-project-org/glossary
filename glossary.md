## KITAB corpus

The corpus of Arabic texts the KITAB project works on. 
The KITAB corpus is a subset of the OpenITI corpus,
containing only those OpenITI texts that are in Arabic
and whose authors died before the year 1000 AH.

## Machine-actionable

Data is machine-actionable if it is structured in a consistent way so that computers 
can easily be programmed to parse its structure and process it. We prefer this term over
its equivalent "machine-readable", because the latter suggests that it is enough
for a computer to be able to open and read the data. 
Typically machine-actionable data formats are XML, JSON, TSV, CSV, YML: 
they use a fixed syntax that helps the computer parse the data. 
Image files are examples of data
that is "readable" by a computer (the computer can open it and display it on your
screen) but not "actionable": the computer cannot easily extract words in the image.
TXT files are also not machine-actionable: a computer can easily open and read 
the data in a TXT file, but they contain no inherent internal structure.

## Markdown

A light-weight markup language designed to make it easy to read and format 
text in plain text files. For example, asterisks are used to format text in
italics (e.g., `*this is italicized*`) or bold (`**this is bold**`).
